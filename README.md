It is common in the SysAdmin trade, the fact of having to deal with a lot of registered information that accumulates on the server or instances, causing the high consumption of space and costs of the project due to the high usability of the computer in an unnecessary way.

That is why, an act of good practice in this branch is to clean the old records when they have passed a considerable period of time, that is, more than a year, or as best is considered, normally, in my experience I have Given that before deleting them completely, these records are saved in a compressed way, and then they can be deleted by programming some crontab action.

ok, then the objective of this set of scripts is to show how we can deal with this task in an efficient way. By automating this series of actions we minimize the fact that by making repetitions in our work we are prone to making mistakes, and in this way we not only get rid of that a bit, but we can also optimize our use of time and labor.

Finally, an idea is that through this small set of scripts, it can validate the use of functions, fine-tune a script a bit, use some basic commands, and actually practice a little bit with git.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Prerequisites

Have a machine (preferably derived from Debian, or RHEL).
For greater ease, you can configure the local environment, following the steps below: 

1. getting a copy of the hiker code, which will help you set up an environment quickly.
   ```sh
   $ curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjfigueroa/packer/hiker/hiker" hiker
   ```
2. Edit the necessary permissions to run it.
   ```sh
   $ chmod +x hiker
   $ ./hiker
   ```
